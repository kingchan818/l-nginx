TLS Termination
-> Nginx has TLS but backend is not
-> Nginx terminate TLS and decrypts and send unencrypted (only admin can see)
-> Terminate TLS, decrypted, optionally rewrite and re-encrypt the contend to backend
-> Nginx can look at the L7 data, rewrite headers, cache but needs to share the backend certificate or at least has its own

TLS Passthrough
-> Backend is TLS
-> Nginx proxies/streams the packets directly to backend
-> TLS handshake is forwarded all the way to the backend
-> Just like a tunnel
-> No caching since Nginx does not have the TLS certificate (L4 check only)
